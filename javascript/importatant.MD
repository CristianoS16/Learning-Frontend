# Learning JavaScript

* Number = int + float, there's no difference
* Always use **let** to create variables
* Use camelCase in js


## *var* X *let*
* var allows redeclaration, the follow code is valid:
    ```js
    var name = "abc"
    var name = "def"
    ```

## *null* X *undefined*

    null !== undefined

`null` It is a decision for the programmer to make the variable does not pursue anywhere in the memory.
